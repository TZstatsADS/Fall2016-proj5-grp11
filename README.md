**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) Rong took charge of Model construction using Markov Chain model with Monte Carlo simulations. (Most of algorithm functions) Youzhu Liu design and code the shiny interactive app for the statistcal insights and prediction models. Mengya Zhao made functions of plots and helped with the shiny app.
